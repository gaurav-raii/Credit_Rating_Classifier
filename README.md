10 folds Cross validation on a Decision tree with different depths was employed to determine the best tree and depth to correctly classify the credit rating.
For each setting a confusion matrix along with the Recall,Accuracy,precison and F1 score was reported and used to identify the best parameters for the tree.
A report was published with the following:
A listing of the python code.
A table of Metrics(recall,accuracy,precision,F1).
Logic behind selecting a particular tree.
A table of metrics on the validation data(70/30 Split) set with the selected model from cross validation.
A screen shot of the tree.
